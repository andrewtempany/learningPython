#pick any date after January of 2010
#dec 15 2015

#let's pretend that you had $1000 dollars to invest at that date

#how much would it be today if you have invested back then and sold in on 1st of April 2019

#remotely download the SPX index from your date to 1st of April 2019

#load the FTSE from the file, and select values from your date  to 1st of April 2019

#normalize the return of each index for "Close" column so you can calculate your total return at any given date

#"invest" $1000 dollars on your date and make sure that you show your total gain/loss at every date

#plot both "investments" in SPX and FTSE on the same graph with names of "US Returns" and "EUR Returns" respectively.
